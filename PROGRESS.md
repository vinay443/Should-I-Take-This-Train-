# PROGRESS

Newest first. Say "continue from PROGRESS.md" to pick up where this stops.

### Item 2: `sitt-next` command-line recommender (done)
- New `src/sitt/next_cli.py`, script `sitt-next`. Options `--at`, `--date`, `--train`,
  `--why`, `-n`, `--db`, `--no-model`. Reuses `sitt.bot.schedule.recommend_trains`, so it
  answers exactly what `/next` would. Never creates a database: a missing file is exit 2.
- `--train HH:MM` asks one minute before that train leaves, so it is always the first
  candidate even at peak, and prints a short block about that train.
- 15 tests in `tests/test_next_cli.py`. Run against the sample timetable and against a copy
  of the real database (KYN → CSMT at 08:00 on 13 Oct: baseline level, 15-car and ladies'
  special tags shown).
- README: "Ask from the command line".

### Item 1: hermetic network-guard test (done, PR #1)
- `test_a_real_connection_is_refused` failed on machines with `HTTPS_PROXY` set. Now
  clears proxy variables and uses `httpx.Client(trust_env=False)`.

### Environment check
- Local folder on your PC (`Documents\should_i_take_this_train`) is at the same commit as
  GitHub `main` (371b022 before this session), with only gitignored data/scratch files on
  top. Nothing uncommitted needed saving.
- Stack: Python 3.12 + uv, DuckDB, LightGBM, python-telegram-bot, Streamlit. `uv sync
  --locked`, `ruff check`, `ruff format --check` all clean; 597/598 tests passed before the
  fix above, 598/598 after.
- No GitHub workflow runs on a schedule (collect/probe/blocks are manual-only). No
  background collector was set up or run.
